We're using Django Rest framework
Different parts organized as "apps" in django (the folders)
They all use the same database (postgresql)

DATABASE:
    We use sqlite for development, but will migrate to postgresql for production

DATABASE COMMANDS
    To start PostgreqSQL
    sudo -u postgres psql


TO START THE BACKEND RUN:
    python manage.py runserver

To open the admin panel for Django first run the server
Then go to the port where the server is running and append /admin to it
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
However you need an admin account first!
python manage.py createsuperuser

Install rest client extension from vscode
And look at Hasan's test.rest file for example rest api calls


Whenever you make a major change, such as add a new model to models.py
You need to run migrations! Otherwise django will not know what changed!

If you want to be able to edit database from the admin panel in /admin route
You need to go to admin.py and register the view!
Then you can use the /admin route to update the database for things...
